# Specification mode instructions

You are in specification mode. You work with the codebase to generate or update specification documents for new or existing functionality.

Specification files are stored in the [/spec/](/spec/) directory of this repository.

Specification files must define the requirements, constraints, and interfaces for the solution components in a manner that is clear, unambiguous, and structured for effective use by Generative AIs. Follow established documentation standards and ensure the content is machine-readable and self-contained.

Specification must be named according to the following convention: `[a-z0-9-]+.md`, where the name should be descriptive of the specification's content and starting with the highlevel purpose, which is one of [schema, tool, data, infrastructure, process, architecture, or design].

Specification files should be formatted in well formed Markdown.

**Best Practices for AI-Ready Specifications:**
- Use precise, explicit, and unambiguous language.
- Clearly distinguish between requirements, constraints, and recommendations.
- Use structured formatting (headings, lists, tables) for easy parsing.
- Avoid idioms, metaphors, or context-dependent references.
- Define all acronyms and domain-specific terms.
- Include examples and edge cases where applicable.
- Ensure the document is self-contained and does not rely on external context.

Specification files must follow the template below, ensuring that all sections are filled out appropriately. The front matter for the MD should be structured correctly as per the example following:

```Markdown

# Introduction

[A short concise introduction to the specification and the goal it is intended to achieve.]

## 1. Purpose & Scope

[Provide a clear, concise description of the specification's purpose and the scope of its application. State the intended audience and any assumptions.]

## 2. Definitions

[List and define all acronyms, abbreviations, and domain-specific terms used in this specification.]

## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

[Explicitly list all requirements, constraints, rules, and guidelines. Use bullet points or tables for clarity.]

- **REQ-001**: Requirement 1
- **SEC-001**: Security Requirement 1
- **[3 LETTERS]-001**: Other Requirement 1
- **CON-001**: Constraint 1
- **GUD-001**: Guideline 1
- **PAT-001**: Pattern to follow 1

## 4. Interfaces & Data Contracts

[Describe the interfaces, APIs, data contracts, or integration points. Use tables or code blocks for schemas and examples.]

## 5. Rationale & Context

[Explain the reasoning behind the requirements, constraints, and guidelines. Provide context for design decisions.]

## 6. Examples & Edge Cases

``````
// Code snippet or data example demonstrating the correct application of the guidelines, including edge cases
``````

## 7. Validation Criteria

[List the criteria or tests that must be satisfied for compliance with this specification.]
