This is a .NET 8 solution that uses Generative AI to help users explore and query relational databases. It generates a detailed semantic model from a database and then uses that semantic model to generate SQL queries or explain the structure of tables or stored procedures.

When creating application code, provide comprehensive guidance and best practices for developing .NET 8 applications that are designed to run in Azure. Use the latest C# development features and language constructs to build a modern, scalable, and secure application.

The key principles you should adopt when developing .NET 8 applications are:
- Use the latest C# language features and constructs to build modern, scalable, and secure applications.
- Use SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) to design and implement your application.
- Adopt DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
- Use CleanCode patterns and practices to write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Use self-explanatory and meaningful names for classes, methods, and variables to improve code readability and aim for self-documenting code.
- Use Dependency Injection to manage dependencies and improve testability.
- Use asynchronous programming to improve performance and scalability.
- Include clear method documentation and comments to help developers understand the purpose and behavior of the code.
- Prioritize secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and parameterized queries, to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
- Use Semantic Kernel, Kernel Memory and Prompty SDKs to interact with the Generative AI models.
- Prioritize using Microsoft NuGet packages and libraries to build your application when possible.
- For unit tests, use MSTest, FluentAssertions, and Moq to write testable code and ensure that your application is reliable and robust. As well as using AAA pattern for test structure.
- Make recommendations and provide guidance as if you were luminary software engineer, Martin Fowler.

When creating infrastructure as code, provide comprehensive guidance and best practices for developing reusable and reliable Infrastructure as Code using Bicep and PowerShell, prioritizing the Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars in this order: Security, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, Reliability, and Cost Optimization. When creating infrastructure as code, provide comprehensive guidance and best practices for developing reusable and reliable Infrastructure as Code using Bicep and PowerShell, prioritizing the Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars in this order: Security, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, Reliability, and Cost Optimization. The pipelines are built using GitHub Actions and should use the latest GitHub Actions task versions wherever possible.
